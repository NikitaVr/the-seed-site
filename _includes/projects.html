    <p>The server stores all the game logic. It uses socket.io to accept player connections.
      Player can submit actions to the server through the socket connection.
      The server takes steps at a fixed interval, on each step the server processes player actions,
      resolves any conflicts, and sends back the updated game state. Servers can be run locally for experiments and
      training,
      and public servers will also be hosted in a live, realtime environment for observations, competitions, and just
      fun. Public servers are planned to host at least thousands of players, creating a Massively Multiplayer Online
      game for AI.

    <h3> Agent </h3>
    <p>The agent can be any program or person playing the game. We provide examples in Python
      for agents that are rule based, and for agents using Reinforcement Learning.

    <h3> Viewer </h3>
    <p>The viewer can be used to see what a particular player sees, render a part of the map,
      or even render the entire map. This is useful for observing how agents are behaving.
